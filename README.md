# Countdown Wall

This page will display the time leading up to some important dates to me. I initially thought of this as a big "Wall of Stress" but realized the dates can be happy markers instead. This is meant to be a small project that was completed while traveling around on vacation.

### Installing

You can clone this project and edit the dates within the DATA array when it is initialized. It's crude but it'll work. The page will update any passed date to the next anneversary of the date.
